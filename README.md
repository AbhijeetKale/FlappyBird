# FlappyBird

This remo aims to develop a basic flappy bird game and implement a genetic algorithm to make the AI algorithm learn how to play the game.

This repo has 2 branches:

1) Master branch: This branch has the game played by AI.

2) Game branch: Anyone can play this just by compiling and running the source code. (SPACE is the control to make the bird jump)



The above game is very basic and does not have any UX implemented yet. Anyone is welcome to add to it.
